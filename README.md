# Smart_object_detection
AI Vision Assistant is a real-time object detection system using a webcam that identifies objects and provides voice feedback. built with python ,opencv, pyttsx3 , a local text-to-speech library that works offline and pre-trained MobileNetSSD model, it helps users- especially the visually impaired-understand their surroundings through audio alerts.
## Features

- Real-time object detection using webcam
- Voice feedback for each newly detected object
- Lightweight and runs on standard laptops (no GPU required)
- Helps visually impaired individuals with real-time environment awareness

## Technologies Used
